# Child Buzzer Synth

A simple 7-key mini-piano toy for a child, built on an Arduino Nano with a
KY-006 passive buzzer. Seven keys play a C-major scale, a knob shifts the
octave, and a "squeeze both ends" gesture toggles a vibrato wobble.

Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/`. Wiring: `WIRING.md`. Enclosure models:
`stl/`.

## Firmware

- Sketch: `firmware/child_buzzer/child_buzzer.ino`
- Tunables (pins, note table, octaves, timings, vibrato, DEBUG):
  `firmware/child_buzzer/config.h`

### Automated checks (no hardware)

Run `bash tests/run.sh` with a C++17 compiler (GCC or Clang). The harness
includes the production `.ino` and replaces only Arduino pin, clock, Serial,
and tone APIs with deterministic fakes. Undefined-behavior sanitizer checks
are enabled. Tests cover debounce/bounce, key priority and release, tone write
suppression, combo thresholds/rearming, 32-bit clock rollover, and octave and
vibrato bounds.

The read-only PR workflow runs these tests and compiles both Nano bootloader
profiles with Arduino CLI 1.5.1 and Arduino AVR core 1.8.8. It never uploads,
flashes, releases or deploys. Host tests do not model AVR memory placement,
physical debounce, timer/audio behavior, or wiring; the AVR compile catches
build and flash/SRAM limits, while acoustic acceptance still needs hardware.

### Flashing with the Arduino IDE

1. Open `firmware/child_buzzer/child_buzzer.ino`.
2. Tools → Board → **Arduino Nano**.
3. Tools → Processor → **ATmega328P** (or **"ATmega328P (Old Bootloader)"** for clones).
4. Tools → Port → your Nano's serial port.
5. Click **Upload (→)**.

### Flashing with arduino-cli

```bash
arduino-cli core install arduino:avr@1.8.8
arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:nano firmware/child_buzzer
arduino-cli upload  --fqbn arduino:avr:nano -p /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX firmware/child_buzzer
# Old-bootloader clones: add :cpu=atmega328old to the FQBN.
```

## How to play

- **Press a key** → its note sounds while held (one note at a time; newest key wins).
- **Turn the knob** → moves all keys up/down by octaves (deep ↔ squeaky).
- **Hold lowest + highest keys together (~0.6 s)** → toggles vibrato on/off
  (two-beep chirp confirms).

## Roadmap

- v2: line/aux audio output jack (design + parts list in the spec appendix).
